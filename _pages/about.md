I was born in Gudivada, Andhra Pradesh, India, and moved to Hyderabad, where I completed all of my education until the 12th grade. After that, I managed to scrape through JEE Mains and got into the <a href="https://www.iiits.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Information Technology, Sri City</a>, for my Bachelor’s in Computer Science.

With my father being a film journalist, I found myself at the cinema every Friday, and my life has largely revolved around <strong>Math and Movies</strong>. From a very young age, I knew I wanted to tell stories, and what fascinated me even more was the idea of conveying rigorously formalized scientific concepts through storytelling.

During my undergraduate years, I worked at two startups as a <strong>Software Engineer</strong>. As part of a startup, I was lucky enough to wear multiple hats, get exposure across the stack, and gain experience in full-stack development, distributed systems and machine learning. After I decided to take my storytelling a step further, I joined <a href="https://www.asu.edu/">Arizona State University</a> for my Master's in Computer Science.

Currently, I am conducting research in the space of distributed database environments and LSM-based key-value stores like RocksDB under <a href="https://asu-idi.github.io/">Prof. Zhichao Cao.</a> Alongside this, I am also building AI and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines as my side projects.

Also, a note that I am looking for full-time opportunities, and if anyone, by mistake (pun intended), happen to stumble upon my website and have an opportunity, feel free to reach out!

Now that's all I say from my side—go around and have a look into my world of computer science and cinema.
